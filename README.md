# Fork Koriki
Koriki is a collection of software for the microSD card of the retro console [Miyoo Mini](https://lemiyoo.cn/product/143.html). It runs on the stock firmware and fundamentally ports the frontend [SimpleMenu](https://github.com/fgl82/simplemenu).

Respecting the great work done by **Rparadise-Team** in the [Original Koriki](https://github.com/Rparadise-Team/Koriki/) this version seeks to bring the file system closer to that used by Batocera, so that the folder structure is more user-friendly for Batocera users and can easily share games and settings between both systems.

Little by little I will be documenting the changes and improvements that are being made in this fork.
